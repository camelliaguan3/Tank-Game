# Tank-Game

## Summer 2022 Project


__Purpose of Project__

I wanted to put my coding skills in practice over the summer and create my very first game from scratch. By implementing a game such as this, I will be able to learn more about the process of game development and creating interfaces. I will be able to design a game, implement it, and test the game throughout my process, and to make the process streamlined, the creation of the game will be separated into ten milestones to be completed throughout the summer. If I am unable to meet a milestone, I will adjust accordingly. New tasks will be added to milestones when appropriate.
